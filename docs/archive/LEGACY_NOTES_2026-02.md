# Legacy Notes (Archived Feb 2026)

This document consolidates historical bootstrap-era status files that are no longer authoritative.

## Replaced Documents

- `BOOTSTRAP_COMPLETE.md`
- `SETUP_STATUS.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Why Archived

Those files captured one-time setup milestones and interim implementation snapshots from early project bootstrapping. They became outdated as:

- Build modes expanded (`Release`, `Release Crinkled`, tiny preset paths)
- Runtime/editor architecture was refactored
- Build and packaging behavior changed significantly

## Current Source of Truth

Use these documents instead:

- [../QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md)
- [../BUILD.md](../BUILD.md)
- [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [../STRUCTURE.md](../STRUCTURE.md)
- [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Historical Context Summary

- Initial project scaffolding and dependency bootstrap completed
- Early UI redesign pass completed (fonts/theme)
- Initial editor/runtime foundation and build flow validated

No active implementation guidance should be taken from the original archived files.
