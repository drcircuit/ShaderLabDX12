## Install

### Installer build

2. Follow setup prompts.
3. Launch **ShaderLab** from Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

### Portable build

1. Extract the portable zip to a writable folder.
2. Run `ShaderLabIIDE.exe`.

## First Launch

- Ensure the app is started from the repository/package root so `editor_assets/` is available.
- Open a project (`Ctrl+O`) or create a new one from **File**.

## Basic Workflow

1. Load or create a project.
2. Edit shader code in Scene/Post FX views.
3. Use preview and transport controls to validate visuals.
4. Save project (`Ctrl+S`).
