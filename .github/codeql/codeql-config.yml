# Paths scanned by CodeQL – everything not listed under paths-ignore.
#
# paths-ignore reasons:
#
#   src/app/runtime  – demo playback code intentionally uses low-level /
#                      unsafe patterns (manual memory management, raw
#                      pointer arithmetic, unsafe casts) for efficiency
#                      and binary-size reasons.  False-positive noise from
#                      this directory would drown out real findings.
#
#   src/app/tiny     – ultra-minimal "tiny player" that strips the C++
#                      runtime and standard library; requires additional
#                      unsafe tricks (e.g. CrinklerX86Compat.cpp) that
#                      are not appropriate for general scanning.
#
#   third_party      – vendored upstream libraries (Dear ImGui, miniaudio,
#                      nlohmann/json, stb_image, ImGuiColorTextEdit).
#                      We do not own or maintain this code.
